# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Steve wants to analyze the behavior of the Stock Market for the years 2017 and 2018. We started by analyzing one stock, the DAQO, but we realized that this process could and should be improved to analyze an entire dataset. 
With this in mind, and with the help of VBA tools we expanded the analysis to include the entire stock market. 
The results were satisfactory, but as it is often said, there is always room for improvement, and this is where this project comes in handy. Refactoring this code could help it run faster and accomplish the same tasks in a more efficient manner. 

### Background
During the last couple of weeks, we were building a VBA script to run through the dataset. In the process, we were learning about loops, conditionals, variables, formatting and other VBA features. However, although the code we wrote to analyze the stocks was working, it was not at its best. For instance the elapsed time to run the analysis was around 1.4 seconds
